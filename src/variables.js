What is the duration of the treatment program?</span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span>Duration can last anywhere from one or two days to several weeks. The length of a hospital stay is determined by several factors: </span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span>â€¢ Severity of illness </span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span>â€¢ Patientâ€™s participation in treatment and insight into his or her condition </span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span>â€¢ Patientâ€™s mental status and improvement since admission </span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span>â€¢ Situation into which the patient is being discharged</span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span>In other words, whether the patient will have a supportive environment with appropriate outpatient treatment after leaving the hospital.</span></p>\n<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"> </p>\n<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>5.

        '<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>1. What is ICU and when is it required?</span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://sukoonhealth.com/psychiatric-services/psychiatric-intensive-care-unit/"><span>ICU</span></a><span> is</span><span> a controlled and safe environment for short-term management of individuals experiencing severe mental health concerns.</span><span> It is required when it becomes difficult to manage the individual dealing with medical and psychological complications, </span><span>challenging behaviors, or violence. ICUs are locked and more secure units, and have a low patient capacity when compared to open psychiatric units. </span></p>\n<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"> </p>\n<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>2. How is it different from acute psychiatric care?</span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span>Three ICUs designed to handle any emergencies with round the clock care, and medical supervision. ICU is required in the acute phase of the illness. It minimizes the risk of self-harm and injury. ICU includes soft padded walls, one nurse dedicated to address oneâ€™s needs, 24*7 dedicated nurse, 24*7 supervision and monitoring and accessibility friendly (handrails, two-way incline hospital bed with rails).</span></p>\n<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"> </p>\n<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>3. Are there any ambulance services available? </span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span>We understand that at the time of emergency there is a need for transportation to the hospital for providing pre medical care. However, we assist in locating the ambulance services nearby that can help the individual in crisis. </span></p>\n<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"> </p>\n<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><span>4. What is the duration of stay in ICU?</span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span>The duration of stay depends upon the severity of condition and response towards treatment. Most individuals only stay on ICU wards for a very short time and are moved to the acute psychiatric </span><a href="https://sukoonhealth.com/psychiatric-hospital-in-Gurgaon/"><span>unit</span></a><span>  as soon as the crisis is over or the risky behaviors are under control. In case if the health deteriorates, the individual is moved to a higher setup depending on the individualâ€™s needs. </span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span> </span></p>\n<p dir="ltr"><span>5. Is 24/7 care given in the ICU?</span></p>\n<p>Yes, our <a href="https://sukoonhealth.com/our-doctors/">psychiatrists</a>, medical supervisors and nursing staff are here to cater to psychological and medical emergencies to provide intensive assessment and comprehensive treatment.</p>',
